### Welcome to The Journey!

My goal for this blog is to share the projects I work on as I work on them. This blog is mostly for me, to be able to share what I'm working on and show people that coding can be fun and helpful.

However, I also want this blog to stand as a source for new programmers, to show them that you will make mistakes, you will start things that are beyond the scope of your knowledge. I want to show that you shouldn't be discouraged by abandoned projects and "small" knowledge base. I don't want you to compare yourself to me, but I want to show you that even someone with 10+ years of coding experience can mess up.

Thanks for coming to the sight, and welcome to the journey!
